					chats will only be stored temporarily in order to determine
					violations of the terms of use. The chats will be deleted no
					later than 14 days after the end of the live stream. The legal
					basis for processing chat data is the performance of our contract
					with you to deliver these services.{' '}

					We offer you the option to verify your account by authenticating
					your identity (this applies for all players of the MYTHIC
					platform, with exception of professional players and streamers,
					who will be verified by other means). Account verification is
					optional and is offered to foster a fair play environment and to
					fight unfair practices, such as smurfing or the use of multiple
					accounts. Please note that to verify your account, you must be at
					least 18 years of age.
				</p>
				<p>
					To authenticate your identity, we use a third party identity
					verification service provider that allows you to submit your ID
					document and a picture, which are processed for ID verification
					purposes. The third-party vendor for the provision of these
					services is Daon Limited, IFSC House, Custom House Quay, Dublin
					1, Ireland (“Daon”).
				</p>
				<p>
					Your ID Verification Information is stored on Daon's European
					Datacenters for as long as you wish to maintain the “verified”
					status in your account. If you would like to delete your MYTHIC

					The information we obtain from our use of cookies will not
					usually contain your personal data. Although we may obtain
					information about your device such as your IP address, your
					browser and/or other internet log information, this will not
					usually identify you personally.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note that if you choose to disable cookies, or similar
					technologies, on your device you may be unable to make full use
					of our Clients and Website.
				</p>
				<p>
					We work with third parties who may also set cookies on our
					Website, for example Google Analytics, Facebook, Twitter, Twitch,
					Discord, Playwire, Google Ads Manager and YouTube, which we use
					to display video content, enable social networking functionality
					and sharing, and to monitor how visitors use our Clients and
					Website. These third party suppliers are responsible for the
					cookies they set on your device.&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
					There are several options available for managing your cookie
					preferences, depending on the cookie type and your device. Each
					of the options are described below. Please note that no one
					option is sufficient to manage all cookies on all devices.
					Therefore, you may wish to combine one or more options for
					complete coverage.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Browser Settings</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					You can use your web browser settings to accept, refuse and
					delete cookies. You can withdraw or modify your consent to our
					use of cookies at any time, with the exception of strictly
					necessary cookies (as described above). To do this, follow the
					instructions provided by your browser (usually located within the
					"Help", "Tools" or "Edit" settings).
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Consent Management Platform</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					In addition, MYTHIC uses a consent management platform ("CMP")
					called OneTrust. You may view the CMP and access your cookie
					settings at CMP. The CMP allows you to consent to the setting of
					optional cookies by us and our third-party partners. Using the
					CMP, you can manage your preferences in relation to how cookies
					are set according to the category of cookie, as described above.
					The CMP also allows us to maintain records of your consent. If
					you wish to update your consent choices via the CMP, please visit
					CMP.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note that as with your web browser settings you will not
					be able to withdraw consent for cookies which are strictly
					necessary for the Service to operate.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Mobile Identifiers</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					On your mobile device, your operating system may provide you with
					options to opt out of interest based advertising or to otherwise
					reset your mobile identifier. This is a unique identifier that
					can be used to identify a mobile device which works in a similar
					way to a cookie. For example, you may use the "Limit Ad Tracking"
					setting (on iOS devices) or a setting to "Opt out of
					Interest-Based Ads" (on Android) which allows you to limit the
					use of information about your use of apps for purposes of serving
					ads targeted to your interests.

				<p>
					With Google Ads, so-called conversion tracking is operated. If

					loses its validity after 90 days and is not used to personally

					website and the cookie has not yet expired, Google and we can
					recognize that the user clicked on the ad and was redirected to

					Insofar as data is processed outside the EU/EEA and there is no
					level of data protection that corresponds to the European

					<strong>Meta Pixel</strong>

				<p>
					We use a so-called tracking pixel of Meta Platforms Ireland Ltd,
					4 Grand Canal Square, Grand Canal Harbour, Dublin 2, Ireland, a
					subsidiary of Meta Platforms Inc, 1601, Willow Road Menlo Park,
					CA 94025, USA, ("Facebook") on our website (“Facebook Pixel”). We
					use Facebook Pixel to track the success of our own Facebook
					advertising campaigns and to optimize the playout of Facebook
					advertising campaigns to interested target groups.
				</p>
				<p>
					After clicking on a Facebook ad or visiting our website, a cookie
					is stored on your terminal device using the pixel on our website.
					The cookie processes data about whether you arrived at our
					website via a Facebook ad and allows us to analyze the user's
					behavior until the purchase is completed. This allows us to track
					the success rate of our Facebook advertising campaigns. In
					addition, the pixel processes data about the fact that you have
					visited our website and allows us to customize the ads played on
					Facebook to your interests.
				</p>
				<p>
					Via the Facebook pixel integrated on our website, a direct
					connection to Facebook's servers is established when you visit
					our website. The information generated by the cookie about your
					use of this website (including your IP address) is transmitted to
					Facebook in the USA.

					&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; In addition to us, recipients of the data

				</p>
				<p>
					The data collected is anonymous for us and does not allow us to

					<strong>
						Use of Cookies in connection with the "watch" services
					</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We use a so-called flash cookie to deliver the "watch" service.
					&nbsp;This flash cookie contains a characteristic character
					string ("User ID"), which makes it possible to play back the
					media content without errors. The legal basis for the processing
					of personal data by means of technically necessary cookies is our
					legitimate interests. Due to the technical necessity, there is no
					possibility of revocation. The personal data generated by the
					flash cookie is anonymized immediately after website
					identification for the purpose of data minimization. The legal
					basis for the anonymization are our overriding legitimate
					interests. The subsequent processing of anonymized data for
					analysis purposes is no longer subject to the GDPR.
