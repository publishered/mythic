					<strong>Information we collect from other sources</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Workable provides Us with the facility to link the data you
					provide to Us, with other publicly available information about
					you that you have published on the Internet – this may include
					sources such as LinkedIn and other social media profiles.
				</p>
				<p>
					Workable’s technology allows Us to search various databases –
					some publicly available and others not, which may include your
					personal data (include your CV or Resumé), to find possible
					candidates to fill Our job openings. Where We find you in this
					way We will obtain your personal data from these sources.
				</p>
				<p>
					We may receive your personal data from a third party who
					recommends you as a candidate for a specific job opening or for
					Our business more generally.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Uses Made Of Your Information</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Lawful basis for processing</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We rely on legitimate interest as the lawful basis on which We
					collect and use your personal data and share it with Workable and
					HireVue. Our legitimate interests are the recruitment of staff
					for Our business.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where you apply for a job opening through the LinkedIn Apply
					functionality, We rely on your consent, which is freely given by
					you during the application process, to disclose your personal
					data to Indeed on the basis described below.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Purposes of processing</strong>
				</p>
				<p>We use information held about you in the following ways:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To consider your application in respect of a role for which
						you have applied.
					</li>
					<li>To consider your application in respect of other roles.</li>
					<li>
						To communicate with you in respect of the recruitment process.
					</li>
					<li>
						To facilitate your hiring process through Our Service
						providers (such as HireVuew and its processors and data
						providers)
					</li>
					<li>
						To enhance any information that We receive from you with
						information obtained from third party data providers.
					</li>
					<li>To find appropriate candidates to fill Our job openings.</li>
					<li>
						To help Our service providers (such as Workable and its
						processors and data providers) and Partners (such as the job
						sites through which you may have applied) improve their
						services.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					<strong>Automated decision making/profiling</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We may use Workable’s technology to select appropriate candidates
					for Us to consider based on criteria expressly identified by us,
					or typical in relation to the role for which you have applied.
					The process of finding suitable candidates is automatic, however,
					any decision as to who We will engage to fill the job opening
					will be made by Our staff.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Disclosure of Your Information</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					As set out above, We pass your information to Our third party
					service providers, including Workable and HireVue, who use it
					only in accordance with Our instructions, their Privacy Policies
					and as otherwise required by law.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where you have applied for a job opening through the LinkedIn
					Apply functionality, and where you have consented to this
					disclosure, We will disclose to LinkedIn certain personal data
					that We hold, including but not limited to a unique identifier
					used by LinkedIn to identify you, and information about your
					progress through Our hiring process for the applicable job
					opening, as well as tangible, intangible, visual, electronic,
					present, or future information that We hold about you, such as
					your name, contact details and other information involving
					analysis of data relating to you as an applicant for employment
					(collectively “Disposition Data”). LinkedIn’s Privacy Notice in
					respect of LinkedIn’s use of the Disposition Data is available on
					LinkedIn’s website.
				</p>
				<p>
					Where you have applied to a job opening through another service
					provider, We may disclose data similar to the Disposition Data
					defined above to such service provider. The service provider
					shall be the data controller of this data and shall therefore be
					responsible for complying with all applicable law in respect of
					the use of that data following its transfer by Us.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>How We Store Your Personal Data</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Security</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We take appropriate measures to ensure that all personal data is
					kept secure including security measures to prevent personal data
					from being accidentally lost, or used or accessed in an
					unauthorised way. We limit access to your personal data to those
					who have a genuine business need to know it. Those processing
					your information will do so only in an authorised manner and are
					subject to a duty of confidentiality.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data
					security breach. We will notify you and any applicable regulator
					of a suspected data security breach where We are legally required
					to do so.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet
					is not completely secure. Although We will do Our best to protect
					your personal data, We cannot guarantee the security of your data
					transmitted through any online means, therefore any transmission
					remains at your own risk.

					EEA. A Data Processor Agreement has been signed between Workable
					Software Limited and its overseas group companies, and between
					Workable Software Limited and each of its data processors. These
					data processor agreements are designed to help safeguard your
