            <div className={styles['terms__section-content']}>
               <p>Your account should not have any bans, including bans in the Steam community, trade ban, community ban and hidden ban. The exception is VAC BAN, if it is present at a game that is not present in our service or in tournaments of which you are not going to take part.</p>
               <p>Your account must be active, have hours for the last two weeks spent in the games that are used on our website, and also have a minimum playing hours. For more information, contact the support service of our service or the captain of your team, as these figures may change.</p>
               <p>The service has a system to reduce the load on the tournament server. In order to correctly link your Steam account to the profile on the site, the CS: GO and DOTA 2 items must not be present in your account inventory. Since Steam has a system, which blocks the trade for items for a certain period of time, (new users) our service allows you to send an trade (to a friend, to your other account or site) without accepting it from the other side. After a successful binding, it is allowed to cancel the trade, in order to avoid the trade of items and their subsequent trade ban. After participating in 5 online tournaments, you will need to, without fail, empty your inventory to participate in further tournaments or attach a new account.</p>
               <p>If your account meets all the above requirements, but the Steam account is not linked to your profile on the site, you need to change the password for the Steam account, go to https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey and untie the Steam web API key, after that go to the Steam profile section "About account", in the Steam Guard settings and click the "Exit from all devices" button, after completing the steps specified in the instructions, try trying to link the Steam account to the account on our service, again.</p>
